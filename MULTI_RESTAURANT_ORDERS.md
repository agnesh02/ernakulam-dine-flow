# Multi-Restaurant Orders Feature 🎯

## Overview
The app now supports **multi-restaurant orders** - customers can add items from multiple restaurants to their cart and place a single order, just like a real food court!

## ✅ What Changed

### Previous Behavior (Removed):
❌ Customers could only order from ONE restaurant at a time  
❌ Cart was cleared when switching restaurants  
❌ Backend rejected orders with items from multiple restaurants  

### New Behavior:
✅ **Order from ANY restaurant** - browse and add items freely  
✅ **Cart persists** - switch restaurants without losing items  
✅ **Single checkout** - pay once for everything  
✅ **Smart grouping** - cart shows items organized by restaurant  
✅ **Automatic order splitting** - backend creates separate orders per restaurant  
✅ **Independent notifications** - each restaurant gets ONLY their order  
✅ **Clean separation** - no confusion about which items belong to which restaurant  

## How It Works

### Customer Flow:
```
1. Browse Restaurant A → Add Pizza to cart
2. Go back to restaurant list
3. Browse Restaurant B → Add Burger to cart
4. Go back to restaurant list  
5. Browse Restaurant C → Add Coffee to cart
6. View cart → See items grouped by restaurant:
   🍕 Pizza Palace
      - Margherita Pizza x1
   🍔 Burger Barn
      - Classic Burger x1
   ☕ Cafe Mocha
      - Cappuccino x1
7. Place order → Backend creates 3 SEPARATE orders:
   - Order #001 → Pizza Palace (₹368)
   - Order #002 → Burger Barn (₹245)
   - Order #003 → Cafe Mocha (₹109)
8. Each restaurant notified ONLY about their order
9. Each kitchen prepares independently
```

### Backend Flow:
```javascript
// Group items by restaurant
const itemsByRestaurant = new Map();
for (const item of items) {
  if (!itemsByRestaurant.has(menuItem.restaurantId)) {
    itemsByRestaurant.set(menuItem.restaurantId, { items: [] });
  }
  itemsByRestaurant.get(menuItem.restaurantId).items.push(item);
}

// Create SEPARATE order for EACH restaurant
for (const [restaurantId, { items }] of itemsByRestaurant) {
  const order = await prisma.order.create({
    data: { restaurantId, orderItems: { create: items }, ... }
  });
  
  // Notify ONLY this restaurant's staff
  io.to(`staff:${restaurantId}`).emit('order:new', order);
}

// Returns array of created orders
return { orders: createdOrders, totalOrders: createdOrders.length };
```

## Considerations & Trade-offs

### ⚠️ Important Considerations:

1. **Multiple Order Numbers**
   - Customer receives multiple order numbers (one per restaurant)
   - Need to track all orders for complete fulfillment
   - Currently: Customer only sees first order in status (needs improvement)

2. **Collection Logistics**
   - Customer needs to visit multiple counters (or central pickup)
   - Each restaurant prepares independently
   - Need clear communication about which counter for which order

3. **Partial Fulfillment**
   - If one restaurant can't fulfill, only that order fails
   - ✅ Other restaurants' orders still proceed
   - Customer gets partial refund for failed restaurant

4. **Total Payment Calculation**
   - Payment calculated across ALL items
   - But orders are split after payment succeeds
   - Each order has its own subtotal + GST + service charge

5. **Order Status Tracking**
   - ✅ Each restaurant has independent order status
   - Customer needs to track multiple order numbers
   - Future: Create unified order group/transaction ID

### ✅ What Works Well:

1. **Order Separation**: Each restaurant gets independent order - no confusion!
2. **Socket Notifications**: Each restaurant only notified about their order
3. **Cart Persistence**: Seamless multi-restaurant browsing
4. **Visual Clarity**: Grouped cart shows items by restaurant
5. **Staff Scoping**: Each kitchen only sees their own orders
6. **Unified Payment**: Single transaction for customer
7. **Revenue Attribution**: Auto-split by order, clean accounting
8. **Independent Status**: Each restaurant can update their order independently

## Future Enhancements

### Recommended Additions:

1. **Per-Restaurant Order Status**
   ```javascript
   order.restaurantStatuses = {
     'pizza-palace': 'ready',
     'burger-barn': 'preparing',
     'cafe-mocha': 'ready'
   }
   ```

2. **Estimated Prep Time Display**
   - Show longest prep time in cart
   - Warning if times vary significantly
   - "Your order will be ready in ~30 min (Burger Barn is preparing)"

3. **Collection Instructions**
   - Where to pick up each item
   - Central collection point vs multiple counters
   - Order ready notifications per restaurant

4. **Revenue Split Reporting**
   - Dashboard showing per-restaurant revenue
   - Commission calculations
   - Payment distribution logic

5. **Partial Order Handling**
   - Allow canceling specific restaurant items
   - Refund calculations
   - Notify customer of changes

6. **Smart Recommendations**
   - "Add a drink from Cafe Mocha?"
   - Cross-restaurant meal combos
   - Complementary items from other vendors

## Staff Login PINs

Each restaurant has a unique PIN for testing:

- 🍛 **Spice Junction**: 1234
- 🥡 **Dragon Wok**: 2345
- 🍕 **Pizza Palace**: 3456
- 🍔 **Burger Barn**: 4567
- ☕ **Cafe Mocha**: 5678
