# 🚀 Vercel Deployment Fix

## The Problem
You're getting "No Next.js version detected" because Vercel is trying to build the wrong directory.

## ✅ Solution

### Step 1: Check Your Vercel Project Settings

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Settings** → **General**
4. Check these settings:

   ```
   Root Directory: ./ (or leave blank)
   Framework Preset: Next.js
   Build Command: npm run build
   Output Directory: .next
   Install Command: npm install
   ```

### Step 2: Verify You're Deploying the Right Repository

**IMPORTANT**: You should have **TWO separate projects** on Vercel/Railway:

1. **Frontend** → Vercel
   - Repository: `ernakulam-dine-flow`
   - Root Directory: `./` (or blank - the root)
   - This contains `package.json` with Next.js

2. **Backend** → Railway (NOT Vercel)
   - Same repository: `ernakulam-dine-flow`
   - Root Directory: `server/`
   - This contains Express + Socket.io

### Step 3: If You Accidentally Created the Wrong Project

If you created a Vercel project pointing to the `server/` directory:

1. **Delete that Vercel project** (it won't work - backend needs Railway)
2. Create a new Vercel project with:
   - Root Directory: `./` (blank or root)
   - Framework: Next.js

### Step 4: Redeploy

After fixing the settings:

```bash
# Commit the new config files
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Vercel configuration"
git push origin development
```

Vercel will auto-redeploy with the correct settings.

## 🔍 Quick Diagnostic

Run this in your terminal to verify your setup:

```bash
# Should show Next.js in dependencies
cat package.json | grep "next"

# Should NOT try to build Next.js
cat server/package.json | grep "next"
```

Expected output:
- Root `package.json`: ✅ Has "next": "^15.0.0"
- Server `package.json`: ❌ No Next.js (only Express)

## ✨ Files I've Created

1. `vercel.json` - Forces Vercel to use Next.js correctly
2. `.vercelignore` - Excludes server/ directory from Vercel build
3. This guide!

## 🎯 Correct Setup Summary

```
Your Repository (ernakulam-dine-flow)
│
├── Frontend Files (app/, package.json, next.config.js)
│   └── Deploy to Vercel (Root: ./)
│
└── server/ (Express backend)
    └── Deploy to Railway (Root: server/)
```

Try redeploying now!
